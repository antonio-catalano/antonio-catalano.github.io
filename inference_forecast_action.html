             <h3> The Quantitative space</h2><br>
            <em>Data</em> are means of transportation.<br>
            <em>Models and tools</em> are the infrastructure.<br>
            <em>The analyst/modeler</em> is the driver.<br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>If the quality of data is good we have reliable means of transportation.</li>
            <li>If models and tools are powerful and robust we have a stable infrastructure.</li>
            <li>If the analyst is skilled and careful we have a wise driver.</li><br><br>
            </ul>
            But an overlooked question still remains: which is the destination?<br><br>
            <hr>

            <h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3><br>

            What does Sergio Leone's masterpiece have in common with our topic?<br>
            Almost nothing, but given the fact that our story has three virtual characters, why not?<br>
            Anyway, let's get serious now.<br><br>

            <b>Inference</b> is the arrival station of the <em>truth</em> town.<br>
            <b>Forecast</b> is the arrival station of the <em>functional</em> town.<br>
            <b>Action</b> is the arrival station of the <em>fitness</em> town.<br><br>

            These are three <em> different</em> destinations.<br><br>

            <b>Inference</b> means that through data we get to <u>understand</u> either the nature of a hidden process or the behaviour of a variable or the properties of a dynamics.<br>
            Most of the time we didn't actually get to understand the hidden object, but we believe we had it all figured out.<br>
            It doesn't make a big difference: the main point is that we believe in an <em>unveiled correspondence</em> between the subject (the inner world of the perceiver) and the object (its outer world).<br>
            And, curiously, everyone thinks he/she has the <em>true</em> correspondence once the inference is made.<br>
            As a matter of fact it doesn't make sense to talk about a <em>false</em> correspondence:
            the notions of <em>correspondence</em> and <em>truth</em> are intimately related.<br>
            Inference happens when idealism becomes friends with materialism.<br><br>

            <b>Forecast</b> instead doesn't care about that at all.<br>
            Forecast simply tries to anticipate a future outcome, without delving into the inquiry of the path that returns that outcome.<br>
            It is not indolent; it simply admits that it <em>can't grasp</em> the dynamic cause-effect series that brings to the outcome.<br>
            Forecast is a bizarre character in our plot: it wants to anticipate a future chapter or sentence of the book (i.e. the model's output) by reading only 
            the current unfinished book and <em>creating</em> the remaining part.<br>
            In other words, forecast knows that it is not able to explain why the reality behaves how it does, but nevertheless, for whatever reasons,
            it makes a bet on the dress that reality will wear.<br><br>

            <b>Action</b> is a forecast character with a survival payoff constraint.<br>
            It is much less light-hearted than the forecast character and far less cocky than the inference one.<br>
            Its aim is not so noble as the <em>inference</em>'s aim: in fact it is not searching for <em>why and how</em>.<br>
            Its aim is not so ego-driven as the <em>forecast</em>'s one: it is not about <em>being right.</em><br>
            Action wants to maximize a survival payoff: and in order to do that it does not only have to guess what future will be like, but, mainly,
            <em>what</em> will happen <cite>if this</cite> and <cite>what if that</cite>.<br>
            Action has no time nor energy to think about the truth, and no privilege allows it to only be right.<br>
            It has to arrive to the next day in the best possible conditions.<br><br>
            <hr>

            <h3>Philosophy, science and power</h3><br>

            Statistical Inference applied to the real world represents a continuation of the quest begun with the Greek philosophy.<br>
            The main difference is that statistical inference places itself within a very different cultural
            atmosphere compared to that by which Thales of Miletus, Socrates, Aristotle and all their <em>"sons"</em> abided.<br>
            Statistical Inference doesn't aim to reach the <em>episteme</em>: in fact it doesn't even believe that the concept of episteme makes sense.<br>
            Nonetheless, every time we pronounce a claim about the functioning of reality (or of a part of it) we are subconsciously 
            assuming that some sort of truth (maybe spatio-temporal conditioned, i.e. <em>not incontrovertible</em> regardless space and time) exists.<br>
            <em>Inference</em>,<em>Truth</em> and <em>Episteme</em> are strictly related concepts, and only by looking them directly in the eyes 
            we understand how problematic every <em>inference-type</em> claim is.<br>
            I would say that the immediate reply someone could make is <em>"hey man, I only want to find the coefficients of this regression in order to <em>explain</em> the relationship
            between <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>"</em>.
            Or <em>"hey man, too much intellectualism: we inferential analysts only want to know how a certain part of reality behaves in absence of 
            deterministic patterns: we aim to make some induction about that through data, models, tools".</em><br>
            Got it, but nothing actually changes in the deep chambers of the discourse.<br>
            Inference can't exist without the existence of the concept of <em>truth</em>.<br>
            When we are making inferences, we are making epistemology, whether we are aware of it or not.<br>
            But without being aware of it we would likely make bad inferences.<br><br>

            Do you agree with me? No? <br>
            Fair enough.<br><br>
            In fact, Statistical Inference (S.I.) <em>is not</em> exactly about <em>Truth</em>.<br>
            <em>Truth</em> is the <b>goal</b> in philosophical and religious traditions.<br>

            It represents un <b>unconditioned</b> concept, not subordinated to concepts like
             <em>empirical verification</em> or <em> falsifiability</em>: in fact it is <em>the</em> unconditioned concept.<br>

            In this sense Science, and hence S.I. as well, are much more humble.<br>
            The truth involved in Science and in S.I. is a truth without capital <em>T</em>.<br>
            Its real name is <em>Explanatory Power</em>.<br>
            <u>While philosophy and religion want to tell us <em>what</em> the world <em>is</em>, science wants to tell
            us <em>how</em> the world behaves.</u><br>
            Statistical Inference is about giving the most powerful explanation in a stochastic territory, full of fog.<br>
            But does the <em>most powerful explanation</em> actually exist in a given situation? And <em>who</em> is able to detect it?<br>
            These questions seem to beg the existence of something deeper.<br>
            Can this <em>something deeper</em> be something different from the concept of <em>Truth</em>? It seems not.<br>
            Or can we say that <em>Explanatory Power</em> has no dependence, no connection with the concept of <em>Truth</em> in a sort of 
            chaotic simulation where <em>it is what it is</em> and that's all?
            <hr>

           
            <h3>The biological world</h3> <br>

            When we work with data in a field which is related, at least to a certain degree, to the biological realm, the Inference  
            character can easily resemble an exhausted war veteran.<br> 
            The complexity of the object of study almost always overwhelms the human ability to carry data to that destination (i.e. the Inference arrival station).<br>
            The Forecast character does a little bit better, provided that it maintains a certain dose of humility.<br>
            The real star of this scene is, as you can imagine, the Action character.<br>
            This is something that many data scientists, economists and analysts may gloss over but it is a crucial point.<br>
            Every time a quantitative framework is aimed for a biology-related field (psychology, economics, finance, social disciplines in general) we have 
            to keep in mind that the destination is neither the Inference nor the Forecast: it is the Action.<br> 
            The studying/modelling process and the related considerations have to take this fact into account.<br>
            And, finally, if Action is the destination of every quantitative study related to a field with biological footprints, isn't it true that 
            data are not sufficient to make a good job?<br> 
            If we evolved until now without statistics and software, isn't it true that, in the name of <em>rigorous analysis</em> we often miss the 
            aim of the analysis itself, so to speak, how can we make a good move in a timely way?<br><br>
            <hr>

            <!--In the mismatching Era of the quantitative dictate used <b>by</b> and <b>for</b> humans with the same genes of hundred thousands of years ago, 
            shouldn't give more credit to our intuitive heuristics? <br>
            Shouldn't we recognize the role of the language of Nature (that we are not able anymore to interpret) and its signals?<br>
            I think not doing that would deprive us of a very special tool in our reality-translator toolbox.<br> -->
            


            <!--You can't talk about Covid-19 if you are considering your quantitative framework something 
            that is related to the Inference or Forecast destination: data, infrastracture and driver are directed to the <b>Action</b> town.<br> -->
            <h3>Things are complex</h3><br>
            
            We know that Inference is noble, with general purposes and a story-telling that would like to be immutable.<br> 
            Instead Action is arduous, with specific goals and a temporary story-telling which is only functional to the best survival.<br> <br>
            In the Action realm a heavy burden joins the picture.<br>
            Unlike Inference and Forecasts "domains", here a fitness payoff is involved, but the problem 
            is: fitness payoff <em>for whom</em>?<br>
            The heavy burden refers to the constant discord between the <em>subject</em> and its complement set: the <em>other</em>.
            <br>
            
            When the destination of data analysis has to be Action, a good analyst 
            might know the best move to take in order to maximize his fitness payoff (or the fitness payoff of a group 
            to which he belongs) but when the object of analysis is not a <em>single player game</em> (e.g. poker, trading, individual health), an Action 
            destination most likely implies political decisions.<br>
            As a matter of fact each data-driven political decision which is taken to 
            make a good "ensemble" move for citizens can't be demonstrated as the <em>best</em> move in an increasingly connected world.<br> 
            When Action doesn't apply to a <em>single player game</em> context, mess becomes an inevitable consequence.<br>
            <br>
            Action and Truth are destined to play in two territories with no intersection.<br><br>
            <hr>

            <!--The reason is simple: the survival payoff is involved in a tougher game compared to that in which 
            the Inference (i.e. a child of the Truth category) is involved, with no theoretical constraints: only the best possible survival gain 
            is hunted.<br><br> -->
            


            <h3>Arrival stations are often merged</h3><br>

            Physics uses both inference and forecast in order to deal with nature.<br>
            Good poker players use both inference (mainly in the form of <em>pattern recognition</em>) and action, in order to prosper at the table.<br> 
            Many social scientists generally use a mixture of bad inference, forecast (especially the economists) and their "true" Action in order to... express their ideas!<br>
            Some other instead seem to recognize the intrinsic limits of their discipline (labile epistemological traits) and 
            try to go the extra mile in order to reach a seemingly impossible task: merging the <em>biological</em> 
            feature of social disciplines, with the <em>opacity</em> feature of complex systems and with the <em>mathematical</em> feature of hard sciences.<br> 
            <br>
            <hr>

            <h3>Last stop</h3><br>

            The path of a <em>quantitative player</em> in stochastic and opaque fields begins with reflection about <em>uncertainty</em> 
            but this reflection, reflexively, recalls the attention to what is <em>certain</em>, <em>absolutely known</em>, <em>true</em>, from which the 
            above mentioned reflection seems to depend on, despite all.<br>
            <br>

      
           <!--  I'd to like to close this article with some considerations when dealing with data:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <li><em>clarity</em> >> <em>sophistication</em> , even if it implies the word <em>simpler</em>.</li>
            <li><em>confidence</em> > <em>humility</em> >> <em>high confidence</em> , because you have to gain confidence while humility remains a rather cheap option, but without the left tail of the high confidence.</li>
            
            <li><em>Claims</em>, in order to make sense, imply the existence of some sort of <em>Truth</em>, even if nobody says to believe in it anymore.<br>
            If you think that <em>Truth</em> is a meaningless word, or at least a problematic one, add a lot of <em>doubts</em> in your thinking process in order to be more coherent.<br>
