             <h3> The Quantitative space</h2><br>
            <em>Data</em> are means of transportation.<br>
            <em>Models and tools</em> are the infrastructure.<br>
            <em>The analyst/modeler</em> is the driver.<br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>If the quality of data is good we have reliable means of transportation.</li>
            <li>If models and tools are powerful and robust we have a stable infrastructure.</li>
            <li>If the captain is skilled and careful we have a wise driver.</li><br><br>
            </ul>
            But an overlooked question still remains: which is the destination?<br><br>
            <hr>

            <h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3><br>

            What does the Sergio Leone's masterpiece have in common with our topic?<br>
            Almost nothing, but given the fact that our story has three virtual characters, why not?<br>
            Anyway, let's get serious now.<br><br>

            <b>Inference</b> is the arrival station of the <em>truth</em> town.<br>
            <b>Forecast</b> is the arrival station of the <em>functional</em> town.<br>
            <b>Action</b> is the arrival station of the <em>fitness</em> town.<br><br>

            Those are three <em> different</em> destinations.<br><br>

            <b>Inference</b> means that through data we get to either <u>understand</u> the nature of a hidden process or the behaviour of a variable or the properties of a dynamics.<br>
            Most of the time we didn't actually get to understand the hidden object, but we believe we had it all figured out.<br>
            It doesn't make a big difference: the main point is that we believe in an <em>unveiled correspondence</em> between the subject (the inner world of the perceiver) and the object (its outer world).<br>
            And, curiously, everyone thinks they have the <em>true</em> correspondence once the inference is made.<br>
            As a matter of fact it doesn't make sense to talk about a <em>false</em> correspondence:
            the notions of <em>correspondence</em> and <em>truth</em> are intimately related.<br>
            Inference is where idealism seeks to be friends with materialism.<br><br>

            <b>Forecast</b> instead doesn't care about that at all.<br>
            Forecast simply tries to anticipate a future outcome, without caring about which is the path that returns that outcome.<br>
            It is not indolent, it simply admits that it <em>can't grasp</em> the dynamic cause-effect series that brings to the outcome.<br>
            Forecast is a bizarre character in our plot: it wants to anticipate a future chapter or sentence of the book (i.e. the model's output) by reading only 
            the current unfinished book and <em>creating</em> the remaining part.<br>
            In other words forecast knows that it is not able to explain why the reality behaves how it does, but neverthless, for whatever reasons,
            it makes a bet on the dress it will wear.<br><br>

            <b>Action</b> is a forecast character with a survival payoff constraint.<br>
            It is much less lighthearted than the forecast character and far less cocky than the inference one.<br>
            Its aim is not so noble as the <em>inference</em>'s aim: in fact it is not searching for <em>why and how</em>.<br>
            Its aim is not so ego-driven as the <em>forecast</em>'s one: it is not only about <em>to be right.</em><br>
            Action wants to maximize a survival payoff: and in order to do that it has not only to guess what the future will be like, but, mainly,
            <em>what</em> will happen <cite>if this</cite> and <cite>what if that</cite>.<br>
            Action has not time nor energy to think about the truth, and no privilege allows him to only be right.<br>
            It has to arrive to the next day in the best possible conditions.<br><br>
            <hr>

            <h3>Philosophy, science and power</h3><br>

            Statistical inference represents a continuation of the quest begun with the greek philosophy.<br>
            The main difference is that statistical inference places itself within a very different cultural
            atmosphere compared to that in which Thales of Miletus, Heraclitus, Socrates and all their sons abided.<br>
            Statistical inference doesn't aim to reach the <em>episteme</em>: in fact it doesn't even believe that an episteme exists.<br>
            Nonetheless, every time we pronounce a claim about the functioning of the reality (or of a part of it) we are subconsciously 
            assuming that some sort of truth (maybe spatio-temporal conditioned, i.e. <em>not incontrovertible</em> regardless space and time) exists.<br>
            <em>Inference</em>,<em>Truth</em> and <em>Episteme</em> are very related concepts, and only by looking them directly in the eyes we understand how problematic is 
            every <em>inference-type</em> claim.<br>
            I would say that the immediate reply someone could make is <em>"hey man, I only want to find the coefficients of this regression in order to <em>explain</em> the relationship
            between <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>"</em>.
            Or <em>"hey man, too much intellectualism: we inferential analysts only want to know how a certain part of the reality behaves in absence of 
            deterministic patterns: through data, models, tools we aim
            to make some induction about that".</em><br>
            Nothing actually changes in the deep chambers of the discourse.<br>
            Inference can't exist without the existence of the concept of <em>truth</em> .<br>
            When we are making inferences, we are making epistemology, whatever we know it or not.<br>
            But without knowing it we would likely make bad inferences.<br><br>

            I used a small trick in the previous sentences.<br>
            In fact Statistical Inference (S.I.) <em>is not</em> exactly about <em>Truth</em>.<br>
            <em>Truth</em> in philosophical and religious traditions is the <b>goal</b>.<br>
             
             
            It represents un <b>unconditioned</b> concept, not subordinated to concepts like
             <em>empirical verification</em> or <em> falsifiability</em>: in fact it is <em>the</em> unconditioned concept.<br>

            In this sense Science, and hence S.I., is much more humble but at the same time much more severe.<br>
            The truth involved in Science and in S.I. is a truth without capital <em>T</em>.<br>
            Its real name is <em>Explanatory Power</em>.<br>
            <u>While philosophy and religions want to tell us <em>what</em> the world <em>is</em>, science wants to tell
            us <em>how</em> the world behaves.</u><br>
            Statistical Inference is about giving the most powerful explanation in a stochastic territory, full of fog.<br>
            But is actually exist the <em>most powerful explanation</em> in a given situation? And <em>who</em> is able to detect it?<br>
            These question seem to beg the existence of something deeper.<br>
            Can this <em>something deeper</em> be something different from the concept of <em>Truth</em>? It seems not.<br>
            Or the <em>Explanatory Power</em> has no dependence, no connection with the concept of <em>Truth</em> in a sort of 
            chaotic simulation where <em>it is what it is</em> and that's all?
            <hr>

            <!-- Poker is a game of incomplete information in which the winner is the one who makes the fewer mistakes.<br>
            There is no <em>Forecast</em> character involved in Poker, only the inference one, but without capital I.<br>
            Indeed the inferential process in poker is directed to serve the Action character: in this sense Poker has many 
            similarities with an evolutionary process, where inferences are not directed to know some truth, but only 
            to survive.<br> 
            Unlike a real evolutionary process, poker Profit/Loss distribution is far less thick tailed, even in the No-Limit cash game mode. 
            That is because you can choose the amount of money you put at risk on the table and almost always there is a maximum entry-level.<br> 
            Tilted player usually do many reload and so their P/L distribution is more tick tailed, but notwithstanding a single hand can't destroy the P/L of a whole year.<br>
            Nevertheless, in my life experience, I didn't find a discipline that hones so much the Action destination.<br> 
            For a simple reason: the more you are attached to your non profitable game-ideas, the more you lose.<br>
            The searching for the most Explanatory Power move (inference) has no place on the table.<br>
            More you play in a naive way, by forecasting the next cards that the dealers will turn on the table, the more you will lose.<br>
            More instead you are able to assemble data in a way that maximizes your payoff, greater is the probability the your bankroll will increase. -->
            <h3>The biological world</h3> <br>

            When we work with data in a field related with a certain degree to the biological realm, the Inference  
            character can easily resamble an exhausted war veteran.<br> 
            The complexity of the object of study almost always overwhelms the human ability to carry data to that destination.<br>
            The Forecast character does better, provided that it maintains a certain dose of humulity.<br>
            The real star of this scene, as you can imagine, is the Action character.<br>
            This is something that many data scientists, economists, analysts, may gloss over but it is a crucial point.<br>
            Every time the quantitative framework is aimed for a biology-related field (psychology, economics, finance, social disciplines in general) we have 
            to have in mind that the destination is neither the Inference nor the Forecast: it is the Action.<br> 
            The studying/modelling process and the related considerations have to take into account this fact.<br>
            And, finally, if the Action is the destination of each quantitative study related to biological domains, isn't it true that 
            data are not sufficient to make a good job?<br> 
            If we evolved until now without statistics and software, isn't it true that, in name of <em>rigourous analysis</em> we often miss the 
            aim of the analysis, so to speak, how to overcome the obstacle with a minimum cost and in a timely way?<br><br>
            In the mismatching Era of the quantitative dictate used by and for humans with the same biological genes of thousand of years ago, we should not overlook the importance of intuitive heuristics.<br>

            <!--You can't talk about Covid-19 if you are considering your quantitative framework something 
            that is related to the Inference or Forecast destination: data, infrastracture and driver are directed to the <b>Action</b> town.<br> -->
